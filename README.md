Macintosh Apps Cookbook
=======================

Installs applications frequently seen on Mac OS X workstations.

As individual recipes evolve, they will be spun off into their
own cookbooks, but it seemed senseless to create 50 different cookbooks
up front.

Requirements
------------

* Mac OS X

#### Cookbooks

- `dmg`

Attributes
----------

Too many to list, but usually there's a URL and checksum for each
piece of software.

Usage
-----

Include the recipe corresponding to the application you want to install
in your run_list.

Contributing
------------

1. Fork the repository on Github
2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)
3. Write your change
4. Submit a Pull Request using Github
